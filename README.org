* Wallpaper changer

Just as imple eww widget that selects a randow wallpaper in the WALLPAPER environment variable directory when the button is clicked
* Todo [1/3]
** TODO Check if the swww daemon is already running in the bash script
** DONE Pick a randow image from the WALLPAPER Directory
** TODO Style the button with nix-colors so it does not look terrible
** TODO Make the entire thing into a complete nix package / derivation
* Plan for this project

- Place the button on top of the image using an overlay
- The image is under the button
- When the button is clicked create a file in a directory that keeps track of the state of the button. Example is on hover set hover state to 1 and change the image of the button
- On click change the click state to 1 so we get a different image for the hover
- Place a background panel image
- Sprite appears to be 5 times the size of the orignal to get a decent sizeon it
